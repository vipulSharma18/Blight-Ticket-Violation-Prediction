# Blight Ticket Violation Prediction
## Summary: 
A Random Forrest Classifier to predict whether a person will pay the blight ticket violation fine. I maximized the AUC score reaching a score of more than 87%.

## Description:
A random forest classifier in scikit-learn was made using raw data from the city of Michigan's data repository. 
The model optimized the AUC score reaching a score of more than 87%. 
The goal of the model was to predict whether a person with a fine or a blight ticket will pay it given the past data of the area from which the person belongs 
and the authority which fined the person.
I had to impute the missing values and clean the data using pandas and sklearn. 
Several tables had to be joined using pandas. I had to go through all the stages of the data science life cycle be it data cleaning, 
preprocessing and model development after doing exploratory data analysis and determine which features to keep in the model.
